# Typing Speed Test ‚å®Ô∏èüöÄ

The faster you type, the faster you communicate with others. With **Typing Speed Test** you can check your WPM (words per minute) , CPM (Characters per minute), Max WPM and accuracy scores in 120 seconds.

## Implementation Details

The implementation of the Typing Speed Test project is quite simple.

- It all starts with the `TypingTest` component. Every time the `TypingTest` component mounts on the UI, it renders different typing text.

- The `generateText()` function in `utils/index.js` is responsible for generating the typing text. Whenever it gets called, it returns a paragraph of 60 random words, so when the `TypingTest` component is rendered on the UI, it calls the `generateText()` function.

- There are two other components in `TypingTest`:

  - **Timer**: As the name suggests, it is responsible for a 60-second countdown. It accepts a single prop to control the timer functionality.
  - **Stats**: The stats component is responsible for rendering WPM (Words Per Minute), CPM (Characters Per Minute), and accuracy statistics.

- The moment the user starts typing, the timer gets started, and `handleUserInput()` starts listening for the `onChange` event until it receives a space (" ") as input. If so, it means the user has finished typing a word.

- Then, `handleUserInput()` compares that word with the typing text to determine whether it is correct or not. Based on this comparison, it updates the word count, character count, and accuracy.

- The stats (word count, character count, and accuracy) are passed to the `Stats` component as props, and it renders the statistics accordingly.

- In the `TypingTest` component, there is also a refresh button beside the input. On clicking this button, it resets the state of the `TypingTest` component, including generating new typing text, resetting the timer, and resetting the word count.

- Additionally, there is a `ResultModal` component that opens when the time is up or the user finishes typing all the words. This modal renders the statistics of the typing session, providing a summary of the user‚Äôs performance.
